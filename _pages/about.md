First and foremost, most people in my home country (Colombia) have two names and two last names, hence the title. 

I currently hold a [postdoctoral researcher position](https://people.ee.ethz.ch/~roandres/) in the Computer Vision Lab ([CVL](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/)) at ETH Zürich, working with prof. Luc Van Gool and Dr. Radu Timofte. Before joining CVL, I spent 5 delightful years in the Biomedical Computer Vision ([BCV](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co/)) group working closely with Pablo Arbelaez at the University of Los Andes in Colombia.

My areas of interest lie in the field of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Technologies, namely Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Particularly, I am interested in developing techniques using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image-to-image translation problems such as image editing, semantic manipulations, style-guided transformations, among others.

During my PhD, I developed a strong connection with the world of Facial Expressions Recognition and Affective Computing.

I was awarded three consecutive times by the Google Research Awards for Latin America (2017, 2016, 2015), recently called Latin America Research Awards (LARA), with my project: “Learning Dynamic Action Units for Three-dimensional Facial Expression Recognition” under the guidance of Prof. Pablo Arbeláez.
